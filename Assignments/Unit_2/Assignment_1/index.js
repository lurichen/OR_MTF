// Write Javascript to perform the following tasks. Please submit links to your assignment on repl.it. Here is the Javascript console we used in class: repl.it

// 1. Perform three basic math operations

let num1 = 5;
num1 += 9;
console.log(num1);

let num2 = 34;
num2 -= 1;
console.log(num2);

let num3 = 9;
num3 *= 2;
console.log(num3);


// 2. Create a variable called "myNum" and assign it a value of 3

let myNum = 3;


// 3. Output/print/return the value of the "myNum" variable

console.log(myNum);


// 4. Assign "mynum" a value of 7

let myNum1 = 7;

// 5. Output/print/return the value of "myNum"

console.log(myNum1);


// 6. Increase the value of "myNum" by 3

let myNum1 += 3;


// 7. Output/print/return the value of "myNum"

console.log(myNum1);


// 8. Create another variable called "myOtherNum" with value 5

let myOtherNum = 5;


// 9. Compare "myNum" and "myOtherNum". Are they equal? Your code should return 'true' or 'false'

myNum === myOtherNum;

// 10. Increase the value of "myOtherNum" by 5

let myOtherNum += 5;
console.log(myOtherNum;)


// 11. Compare "myNum" and "myOtherNum". Are they equal? Your code should return 'true' or 'false'

myNum === myOtherNum;

// 12. Create a third variable called "myString" with value "10" (note: "2" should be a string, NOT a number)

let myString = 10;
console.log(myString);
